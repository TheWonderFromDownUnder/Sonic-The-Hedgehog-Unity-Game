<h1>Sonic The Hedgehog Unity Video Game Project</h1>
This project will consist of producing a video game made in the Unity game engine based around Sonic The Hedgehog. The Sonic The Hedgehog games are 2D Platformers known for their unique momentum physics system that allows you to pick up or lose speed significantly based on the current terrain.
This project has come to be based on my personal desire to produce a video game. I have had experience making simpler games before, but I hope that creating a 2D Platformer, that which features a physics system similar to the Sonic games on the Sega Mega Drive, will prove to be a sufficient, formative challenge for me to overcome.
This project should be a learning experience for myself, to determine if I can make a video game with complexity beyond what I have made in the past. It should also demonstrate the ease/difficulty of making such a game in the Unity game engine, and how much of a difference our current knowledge and understanding of such systems will effect those concerns.
I hope that this project will prove to be of interest to fans of the Sonic The Hedgehog series, as well as people who are interested in game development, whether it be analysing it, or hoping to develop a game for themselves.
